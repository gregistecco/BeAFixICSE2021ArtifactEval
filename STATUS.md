Badges we are applying for: **Reusable**, **Available**. 

We apply for the Available badge as our tool is available in a public repository, it requires dependencies that are also publicly available, and we make available all our source code and scripts to facilitate its usage, including a Docker image with the tool installed and configured, and all the required experimental data (case studies). 

We apply for the Reusable badge as our tool's site includes detailed documentation on how to use the tool, in particular to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. These instructions can also be followed to use the tool on other examples and case studies, of similar characteristics of those used in the experiments. We have provided both a command-line interface for the tool, more convenient for reproducing the experiments, and a graphical user interface for it integrated into Alloy Analyzer, to allow users to interact with the tool more conveniently, and try out their own faulty Alloy specifications.
